      <p>
      I love to doodle, listen to music, and sew!
      I also have a site on neocities and actually quite enjoy html/css!
      I however have not learnt Javascript yet but was trying to teach myself in the holidays.
      I work best having someone I know next to me, for the past few lessons that has been Louie!
      I can work in silence but work better with moderate noise.
      Thank you for readign this, and please check out the cooler page! (passion page)
